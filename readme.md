# BasicControls
Practice with the common controls on Visual Studio

This is my first solution from Visual Studio in the _DVI_ subject.

It´s been a first contact with **IDE** and **C#** lenguage. I have done all exercises without naming any *Control/Component*.
I have only commented too much the code because I have not developed any method made by me.

Then, the links to each exercise folder project:

* [Click on the label and pop a Hello message](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/blob/master/BasicControlsApp1)
* [Show the status of a checkbox](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/blob/master/CheckBoxStatusApp)
* [Sum two numbers from two textboxs](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/tree/master/SumTextBoxesApp)
* [Substraction method added to the previous exercise ](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/tree/master/SumSubstractApp)
* [Substract or Sum choosen from Listbox](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/tree/master/SumSubstractListApp)
* [The checkbox´s text showed on a textBox](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/tree/master/AnimalsChooseApp)
* [The radiobutton choice showed on a textBox](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/tree/master/RadioButtonColorApp)
* [The colour choosen from comboBox](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/tree/master/ComboBoxColorsApp)
* [Load any list into a Listbox](https://github.com/miquelpaucasesnoves/BasicControls/tree/master/ListBoxClassroomApp)
